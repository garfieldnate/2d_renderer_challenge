# The 2D Renderer Challenge — Java

Chapters 1-3, hand-rolled test runner, no JUnit, no network.

## Compile, test, render

Run from this directory (`reference/` and `features/` resolve as relative paths):

```
javac -d classes src/*.java
java -cp classes Chapter01Tests
java -cp classes Chapter02Tests
java -cp classes Chapter03Tests
```

Each run prints one `PASS`/`FAIL` line per scenario, a pass/fail total, and
then writes that chapter's renders to `out/` (chapter 1 as P3, chapters 2-3 as
P6): `out/disc-centers.ppm`, `out/disc-coverage.ppm`, `out/painted-twice.ppm`,
`out/plate-02.ppm`, `out/fan-bresenham.ppm`, `out/fan-wu.ppm`,
`out/fan-coverage.ppm`, `out/plate-03.ppm`.

## Chapter 3

Lines: Bresenham (`Lines.lineBresenham`), Wu (`Lines.lineWu`), and a line as
a thin rectangle (`ThickLine`, a `Shape` built from four `HalfPlane`s and
rasterized with chapter 2's supersampler). `Lines.litPixels` and
`Lines.totalInk` are the chapter's test helpers.
